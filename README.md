# free-genai-bootcamp-2025

## Overview
Welcome to my "free-genai-bootcamp-2025" repository. This bootcamp focuses on leveraging AI to enhance language learning experiences. As an AI Engineer for a Japanese Language Learning School, my mission is to extend the language offerings and augment the learning experience for students between instructor-led classes. Since I have no knowledge of Japanese, I chose to use Swedish, which I am currently studying, to be able to verify the AI's responses.

## Bootcamp Topic
You've been hired as an AI Engineer for a Swedish Language Learning School to:
- Extend the language offering.
- Augment the learning experience for students between instructor-led classes.

The school has an existing learning portal and learning record store. Your tasks include:
- Building a collection of learning apps using various AI use-cases.
- Maintaining the learning experience on the learning portal using AI developer tools.
- Extending the platform to support various languages.

## Repository Contents
The repository currently includes the following parts:

### 1. Architecting GenAI
**Business Goal:** 
As a Solution Architect, after consulting with real-world AI Engineers, you have been tasked with creating architectural diagrams that serve as teaching aids to help stakeholders understand the key components of GenAI workloads. The outcome is to help stakeholders visualize possible technical paths and technical uncertainty when adopting GenAI.

**Objectives:**
- Guide key stakeholders through the technical landscape without directly prescribing solutions.
- Foster informed discussions about infrastructure choices, integration patterns, and system dependencies across the organization.
- Utilize all levels of technical diagramming to achieve the goal.

### 2. Sentence Constructor
**Business Goal:** 
A chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students in translating a target English sentence into Swedish. The teaching assistant's role is to provide guidance rather than direct answers.

**Discussion Point:** 
Will AI-Powered Assistants replace real teachers?
