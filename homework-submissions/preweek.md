### Hypothesis and Technical Uncertainty
- Use Swedish language instead of Japanese because it is hard to verify AI answers with no knowledge of the language 
- Use only free version of AI assistants to explore their capacities
- Swedish language is easier than Japanese (based of bootcamp demonstration)
- The AI assistants can forget some part of the prompt

### Technical Exploration
- I based my first prompt on bootcamp demonstration 
- I modify and add information in my first prompt based on the slide "Anatomy of a prompt" in [Rola Dali video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeExPzfxbxM&t=800s)
- I asked Microsoft Copilot to help me a little bit for the first prompt
- I try the same prompt of all the GenAI I choose to see their differences : test the prompt by running it and analyze the answer at each iteration
- Examples are necessary to explains more what we need
- I Explore how to improve each part to have what I want

### Final Outcomes
- Not all LLMs are the same: it is necessary to analyse different GenAIs to have the best one corresponding to our needs
- It is hard to have a good prompt that can work for every GenAI
- A good prompt requires a lot of iterations
- I learn very interesting prompting techniques
- At this moment, it will be hard for an AI assistant to replace a teacher

### Thinking after submission 
- I think separate the prompt in 2 will be more efficient. 1 for the english sentence submissions and 1 for swedish attempts.
