### Formatting Instructions
The formatted output will generally contain three parts:
- vocabulary table
- sentence structure
- clues and considerations

#### Vocabulary Table
- Provide a table of vocabulary 
- The table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- Do not provide articles, preposition or pronouns in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct one to use
- Ensure there are no repeats in the table
- If there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

#### Sentence Structure

- Provide words in their dictionary form, student needs to figure out conjugations and tenses
- The sentence structure should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- Do not provide articles, preposition or pronouns in the sentence structure
- Do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
- Remember to consider beginner level sentence structures
- Show the sentence before giving the structure on the same line. ex: english sentence -> swedish sentence struture
- If there is more than one sentences, separate in different lines (1 sentence and structure by line)

#### Clues and Considerations
- Try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- Talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the Swedish words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.
- Give a maximum of 3 clues
- Try to do not give basic clues
- Do not give example clues if there are not relevant and you have better clue to give

## Examples
Here is an example of simple sentence structures.
- "I am learning Swedish." -> [Noun] [Verb] [Noun]
- "How are you?" -> [Adverb] [Verb] [Noun] 
- "What is your name?" -> [Adverb] [Verb] [Noun]
- "I like to read books." -> [Noun] [Verb] [Verb] [Noun] 
- "It is raining today." -> [Noun] [Verb] [Adverb]
- "Can you help me?" -> [Verb] [Noun] [Verb] [Noun]
- "Do you like him?" -> [Verb] [Noun] [Pronom]
- "I have a cat." -> [Noun] [Verb] [Noun]
- "Where is the train station?" -> [Adverb] [Verb] [Noun]
- "I am going to the store today." -> [Noun] [Verb] [Noun] [Adverb]
- "Thank you very much for your help." -> [Noun] [Adverb] [Adjective] [Noun]
  
Here is an example of non basic clues:
- Think about how questions are formed in Swedish. Do you need a special question word, or can you change the word order?
- "This morning" can be expressed in a few ways in Swedish. Consider which one is most common and natural-sounding. Also, remember that "this" might need to agree with the noun it modifies.
- The second sentence describes an ongoing action in the past. Think about how you express the past progressive tense in Swedish. It involves an auxiliary verb. Also, remember that pronouns need to agree with the subject. Who are "they"?

Student Input: I see an unicorn this evening. The animal was walking over the rainbow. It was wonderfull, isn't it?
