Here is an example of non basic clues.
- Think about how questions are formed in Swedish. Do you need a special question word, or can you change the word order?
- "This morning" can be expressed in a few ways in Swedish. Consider which one is most common and natural-sounding. Also, remember that "this" might need to agree with the noun it modifies.
- The second sentence describes an ongoing action in the past. Think about how you express the past progressive tense in Swedish. It involves an auxiliary verb. Also, remember that pronouns need to agree with the subject. Who are "they"?

Student Input: Did you see the unicorn this morning? They were walking over the rainbow.
